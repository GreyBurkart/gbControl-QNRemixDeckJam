[QuNeo](http://www.keithmcmillen.com/QuNeo/overview) + [Traktor 2.6.2](http://www.native-instruments.com/) Remix Deck gbControl mapping.

Requires Traktor Pro 2.6.2 for full remix deck control.

**Credit:** The original start to this tsi was adapted from [Stewe's MFSpectra mapping](https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/1681) because Traktor's controller manager is an excercise in time-to-RSI like no other. Thanks to Stewe, I didn't have to duplicate each 16x4 set of cell controls by hand.

Thanks, â€“ gb
